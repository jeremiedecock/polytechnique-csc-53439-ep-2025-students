    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this lab is to introduce some classic algorithms of *Learning from Demonstrations*. We will see how they work, their caveats and benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Learning from Demonstrations* (LfD) is an approach in reinforcement learning where an agent learns behaviors by observing examples provided by a demonstrator. This field is divided into two main branches: *Imitation Learning* and *Inverse Reinforcement Learning* (IRL).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imitation Learning** involves directly mimicking the demonstrator's actions. The agent learns to replicate the demonstrated behavior without attempting to infer the underlying objectives or rewards driving the actions. It focuses on reproducing successful behaviors in a given task, often through supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)**, on the other hand, seeks to infer the demonstrator's underlying reward function. Instead of copying actions, the agent tries to discover the goals or preferences that motivated the demonstrator’s behavior. Once the reward function is learned, the agent can optimize its own policy to achieve similar outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches aim to accelerate learning in complex environments by leveraging expert knowledge, but they differ in how they approach the problem of learning from demonstrations."
